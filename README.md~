# AFMSim
This project is an atomic force microscopy simulation written in C++ using a truncated many-body Lennard-Jones potential.

It was written as part of a final year physics project and is capable of producing images matching closely woth experiment.
Forces can also be calculated in xy, xz, or yz planes.
AFM tips and survaces can be imported from a crystallographuc program, Vesta: http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/
